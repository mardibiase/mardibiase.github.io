Hey, I am Marco. Welcome to my personal page. 

I am a Researcher at [Software Improvement Group](https://sig.eu/){:target="_blank"} in Amsterdam
and PhD at [The Software Engineering Research Group](https://serg-delft.github.io/){:target="_blank"} - 
Delft University of Technology - The Netherlands.

I am a Software Engineer at heart. My research focuses on Software Quality, more 
specifically Software Maintainability, Analytics and Code Reviews.

I was born in Foggia, Italy. I have always been passionate about computers and 
software in general, so I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering and
make it my job. I got my M.Sc. from 
[University of Sannio](https://www.ding.unisannio.it), Italy (2015).
