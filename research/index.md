[http://senecaproject.github.io](http://senecaproject.github.io){:target="_blank"}

I'm involved in the SENECA project, which is a European Industrial Doctorate project, funded under Marie-Skłodowska Curie Actions.It provides the opportunity to early-stage researchers to pursue their PhD in the area of software engineering systems.

My track is:

# Impact of Code Review in Cloud Computing Development

## Overview
Most large software development projects use code review to improve the quality of the code changes merged to the main code base. Yet, little is known on how this process affects to important parameters of development and deployment processes. By analyzing code review repositories, and other repositories with information about development and deployment, we expect to better understand how code review affects to the whole development and deployment process, when bottlenecks are caused, when unnecessary delays are found, how expensive code review is in terms of impact on different metrics, and to which extent it has an overall positive impact.
